# Q2_Enrollment_TS

# Lesson One: Enrollment dApp

In this lesson, we are going to: 
1. Learn how to use `@solana/web3.js` to create a new keypair
2. Use our Public Key to airdrop ourselves some Solana devnet tokens
3. Make Solana transfers on devnet
4. Empty your devnet wallet into your WBA wallet
5. Use our WBA Private Key to enroll in the WBA enrollment dApp

Prerequisites:
1. Have NodeJS installed
2. Have yarn installed
3. Have a fresh folder created to follow this tutorial and all future tutorials

Let's get into it!

## 1. Create a new Keypair

To get started, we're going to create a keygen script and an airdrop script for our account.

#### 1.1 Setting up
Start by opening up your Terminal. We're going to use `yarn` to create a new Typescript project.

```sh
mkdir airdrop && cd airdrop
yarn init -y
```

Now that we have our new project initialised, we're going to go ahead and add `typescript`, `bs58` and `@solana/web3.js`, along with generating a `tsconfig.js` configuration file.

```sh
yarn add @types/node typescript @solana/web3.js bs58
yarn add -D ts-node
touch keygen.ts
touch airdrop.ts
touch transfer.ts
touch enroll.ts
yarn tsc --init --rootDir ./ --outDir ./dist --esModuleInterop --lib ES2019 --module commonjs --resolveJsonModule true --noImplicitAny true
```

Finally, we're going to create some scripts in our `package.json` file to let us run the three scripts we're going to build today:

```js
{
  "name": "airdrop",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "license": "MIT",
  "scripts": {
    "keygen": "ts-node ./keygen.ts",
    "airdrop": "ts-node ./airdrop.ts",
    "transfer": "ts-node ./transfer.ts",
    "enroll": "ts-node ./enroll.ts"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@solana/web3.js": "^1.75.0",
    "@types/node": "^18.15.11",
    "typescript": "^5.0.4"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "ts-node": "^10.9.1"
  }
}
```

Alright, we're ready to start getting into the code!

#### 1.2 Generating a Keypair
Open up `./keygen.ts`. We're going to generate ourselves a new keypair.

We'll start by importing `Keypair` from `@solana/web3.js`

```ts
import { Keypair } from "@solana/web3.js";
```

Now we're going to create a new Keypair, like so:

```ts
//Generate a new keypair
let kp = Keypair.generate()
console.log(`You've generated a new Solana wallet: ${kp.publicKey.toBase58()}

To save your wallet, copy and paste the following into a JSON file:

[${kp.secretKey}]`)
```

Now we can run the following script in our terminal to generate a new keypair!

```sh
yarn keygen
```

This will generate a new Keypair, outputting its Address and Private Key like so:
```
You've generated a new Solana wallet: 2sNvwMf15WPp94kywgvfn3KBNPNZhr5mWrDHmgjkjMhN

To save your wallet, copy and paste your private key into a JSON file:

[34,46,55,124,141,190,24,204,134,91,70,184,161,181,44,122,15,172,63,62,153,150,99,255,202,89,105,77,41,89,253,130,27,195,134,14,66,75,242,7,132,234,160,203,109,195,116,251,144,44,28,56,231,114,50,131,185,168,138,61,35,98,78,53]
```

If we want to save this wallet locally. To do this, we're going run the following command:

```sh
touch dev-wallet.json
```
This creates the file `dev-wallet.json` in our `./airdrop` root directory. Now we just need to paste the private key from above into this file, like so:

```json
[34,46,55,124,141,190,24,204,134,91,70,184,161,181,44,122,15,172,63,62,153,150,99,255,202,89,105,77,41,89,253,130,27,195,134,14,66,75,242,7,132,234,160,203,109,195,116,251,144,44,28,56,231,114,50,131,185,168,138,61,35,98,78,53]
```

Congrats, you've created a new Keypair and saved your wallet. Let's go claim some tokens!

## 2. Claim Token Airdrop
Now that we have our wallet created, we're going to import it into another script

This time, we're going to import `Keypair`, but we're also going to import `Connection` to let us establish a connection to the Solana devnet, and `LAMPORTS_PER_SOL` which lets us conveniently send ourselves amounts denominated in SOL rather than the individual lamports units.

```ts
import { Connection, Keypair, LAMPORTS_PER_SOL } from "@solana/web3.js"
```

We're also going to import our wallet and recreate the `Keypair` object using its private key:

```ts
import wallet from "./dev-wallet.json"

// We're going to import our keypair from the wallet file
const keypair = Keypair.fromSecretKey(new Uint8Array(wallet));
```

Now we're going to establish a connection to the Solana devnet:
```ts
//Create a Solana devnet connection to devnet SOL tokens
const connection = new Connection("https://api.devnet.solana.com");
```

Finally, we're going to claim 2 devnet SOL tokens:
```ts
(async () => {
    try {
        // We're going to claim 2 devnet SOL tokens
        const txhash = await connection.requestAirdrop(keypair.publicKey, 2 * LAMPORTS_PER_SOL);
        console.log(`Success! Check out your TX here: 
        https://explorer.solana.com/tx/${txhash}?cluster=devnet`);
    } catch(e) {
        console.error(`Oops, something went wrong: ${e}`)
    }
})();
```

Here is an example of the output of a successful airdrop:

```
Success! Check out your TX here:
https://explorer.solana.com/tx/459QHLHJBtkHgV3BkzGKo4CDSWzNr8HboJhiQhpx2dj8xPVqx4BtUPCDWYbbTm426mwqmdYBhEodUQZULcpvzd5z?cluster=devnet
```

## 3. Transfer tokens to your WBA Address
Now we have some devnet SOL to play with, it's time to create our first native Solana token transfer. When you first signed up for the course, you gave WBA a Solana address for certification. We're going to be sending some devnet SOL to this address so we can use it going forward.

We're going to open up `transfer.ts` and import the following items from `@solana/web3.js`:
```ts
import { Transaction, SystemProgram, Connection, Keypair, LAMPORTS_PER_SOL, sendAndConfirmTransaction, PublicKey } from "@solana/web3.js"
```

We will also import our dev wallet as we did last time:
```ts
import wallet from "./dev-wallet.json"

// Import our dev wallet keypair from the wallet file
const from = Keypair.fromSecretKey(new Uint8Array(wallet));

// Define our WBA public key
const to = new PublicKey("GLtaTaYiTQrgz411iPJD79rsoee59HhEy18rtRdrhEUJ");
```

And create a devnet connection:
 
```ts
//Create a Solana devnet connection
const connection = new Connection("https://api.devnet.solana.com");
```

Now we're going to create a transaction using `@solana/web3.js` to transfer 0.1 SOL from our dev wallet to our WBA wallet address on the Solana devenet. Here's how we do that:
```ts
(async () => {
    try {
        const transaction = new Transaction().add(
            SystemProgram.transfer({
                fromPubkey: from.publicKey,
                toPubkey:  to,
                lamports: LAMPORTS_PER_SOL/100,
            })
        );
        transaction.recentBlockhash = (await connection.getLatestBlockhash('confirmed')).blockhash;
        transaction.feePayer = from.publicKey;
        
        // Sign transaction, broadcast, and confirm
        const signature = await sendAndConfirmTransaction(
            connection,
            transaction,
            [from]
        );
        console.log(`Success! Check out your TX here: 
        https://explorer.solana.com/tx/${signature}?cluster=devnet`);
    } catch(e) {
        console.error(`Oops, something went wrong: ${e}`)
    }
})();
```

## 4. Empty devnet wallet into WBA wallet

Okay, now that we're done with our devnet wallet, let's also go ahead and send all of our remaining lamports to our WBA dev wallet. It is typically good practice to clean up accounts where we can as it allows us to reclaim resources that aren't being used which have actual monetary value on mainnet.

To send all of the remaining lamports out of our dev wallet to our WBA wallet, we're going to need to add in a few more lines of code to the above examples so we can:
1. Get the exact balance of the account
2. Calculate the fee of sending the transaction
3. Calculate the exact number of lamports we can send whilst satisfying the fee rate

```ts
(async () => {
    try {
        // Get balance of dev wallet
        const balance = await connection.getBalance(from.publicKey)

        // Create a test transaction to calculate fees
        const transaction = new Transaction().add(
            SystemProgram.transfer({
                fromPubkey: from.publicKey,
                toPubkey: to,
                lamports: balance,
            })
        );
        transaction.recentBlockhash = (await connection.getLatestBlockhash('confirmed')).blockhash;
        transaction.feePayer = from.publicKey;

        // Calculate exact fee rate to transfer entire SOL amount out of account minus fees
        const fee = (await connection.getFeeForMessage(transaction.compileMessage(), 'confirmed')).value || 0;

        // Remove our transfer instruction to replace it
        transaction.instructions.pop();

        // Now add the instruction back with correct amount of lamports
        transaction.add(
            SystemProgram.transfer({
                fromPubkey: from.publicKey,
                toPubkey: to,
                lamports: balance - fee,
            })
        );

        // Sign transaction, broadcast, and confirm
        const signature = await sendAndConfirmTransaction(
            connection,
            transaction,
            [from]
        );
        console.log(`Success! Check out your TX here: 
        https://explorer.solana.com/tx/${signature}?cluster=devnet`)
    } catch(e) {
        console.error(`Oops, something went wrong: ${e}`)
    }
})();
```

As you can see, we created a mock version of the transaction to perform a fee calculation before removing and reading the transfer instruction, signing and sending it. You can see from the outputted transaction signature on the block explorer here that the entire value was sent to the exact lamport:
```
Check out your TX here:

```

## 5. Submit your completion of the WBA pre-requisites program
When you first signed up for the course, you gave WBA a Solana address for certification and your Github account. Your challenge now is to use the devnet tokens you just airdropped and transferred to yourself to confirm your enrollment in the course on the Solana devnet.

In order to do this, we're going to have to quickly familiarise ourselves with two key concepts of Solana:

1. **PDA (Program Derived Address)** - A PDA is used to enable our program to "sign" transactions with a Public Key derived from some kind of deterministic seed. This is then combined with an additional "bump" which is a single additional byte that is generated to "bump" this Public Key off the elliptic curve. This means that there is no matching Private Key for this Public Key, as if there were a matching private key and someone happened to possess it, they would be able to sign on behalf of the program, creating security concerns.

2. **IDL (Interface Definition Language)** - Similar to the concept of ABI in other ecosystems, an IDL specifies a program's public interface. Though not mandatory, most programs on Solana do have an IDL, and it is the primary way we typically interact with programs on Solana. It defines a Solana program's account structures, instructions, and error codes. IDLs are .json files, so they can be used to generate client-side code, such as Typescript type definitions, for ease of use.

Let's dive into it!

#### 5.1 Consuming an IDL in Typescript
For the purposes of this class, we have published a WBA pre-requisite course program to the Solana Devnet with a public IDL that you can use to provide onchain proof that you've made it to the end of our pre-requisite coursework. 

You can find our program on Devnet by this address: [HC2oqz2p6DEWfrahenqdq2moUcga9c9biqRBcdK3XKU1](https://explorer.solana.com/address/HC2oqz2p6DEWfrahenqdq2moUcga9c9biqRBcdK3XKU1?cluster=devnet)

If we explore the devnet explorer, there is a tab called "[Anchor Program IDL](https://explorer.solana.com/address/HC2oqz2p6DEWfrahenqdq2moUcga9c9biqRBcdK3XKU1/anchor-program?cluster=devnet)" which reveals the IDL of our program. If you click the clipboard icon at the top level of this JSON object, you can copy the IDL directly from the browser. The result should look something like this:

```json
{
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "name": "wba_prereq",
  "instructions": [
    {
      "name": "complete",
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

As you can see, this defines the schema of our program with a single instruction called `complete` that takes in 1 argument:
1. `github` - a byte representation of the utf8 string of your github account name

As well as 3 accounts:
1. `signer` - your public key you use to sign up for the WBA course
2. `prereq` - an account we create in our program with a custom PDA seed (more on this later)
3. `systemAccount` - the Solana system program which is used to execute account instructions

In order for us to consume this in typescript, we're going to go and create a `type` and an `object` for it. Let's start by creating a folder in our root directory called `programs` so we can easily add additional program IDLs in the future, along with a new typescript file called `wba_prereq.ts`.

```sh
mkdir programs
touch ./programs/wba_prereq.ts
```

Now that we've created the `wba_prereq.ts` file, we're going to open it up and create our `type` and `object`.

```ts
export type WbaPrereq = { "version": "0.1.0", "name": "wba_prereq", ...etc }
export const IDL: WbaPrereq = { "version": "0.1.0", "name": "wba_prereq", ...etc }
```

Our `type` and `object` are now ready to import this into Typescript, but to actually consume it, first, we're going to need to install Anchor, a Solana development framework, as well as define a few other imports.

Let's first install `@project-serum/anchor`:
```sh
yarn add @project-serum/anchor
```

Now let's open up `enroll.ts` and define the following imports:

```ts
import { Connection, Keypair, SystemProgram, PublicKey } from "@solana/web3.js"
import { Program, Wallet, AnchorProvider, Address } from "@project-serum/anchor"
import { WbaPrereq, IDL } from "./programs/wba_prereq";
import wallet from "./wba-wallet.json"
```

Note that we've imported a new wallet filed called `wba-wallet.json`. Unlike the dev-wallet.json, this should contain the private key for an account you might care about. To stop you from accidentally comitting your private key(s) to a git repo, consider adding a `.gitignore` file. Here's an example that will ignore all files that end in `wallet.json`:

```.gitignore
*wallet.json
```

As with last time, we're going to create a keypair and a connection:
```ts
// We're going to import our keypair from the wallet file
const keypair = Keypair.fromSecretKey(new Uint8Array(wallet));

// Create a devnet connection
const connection = new Connection("https://api.devnet.solana.com");
```

To register ourselves as having completed pre-requisites, we need to submit our github account name as a utf8 buffer:
```ts
// Github account
const github = Buffer.from("<your github account>", "utf8");
```

Now we're going to use our connection and wallet to create an Anchor provider:
```ts
// Create our anchor provider
const provider = new AnchorProvider(connection, new Wallet(keypair), { commitment: "confirmed"});
```

Finally, we can use the Anchor `provider`, our IDL `object` and our IDL `type` to create our anchor `program`, allowing us to interact with the WBA prerequisite program.
```ts
// Create our program
const program = new Program<WbaPrereq>(IDL, "HC2oqz2p6DEWfrahenqdq2moUcga9c9biqRBcdK3XKU1" as Address, provider);
```

#### 5.2 Creating a PDA
Now we need to create a PDA for our `prereq` account. The seeds for this particular PDA are:

1. A Utf8 `Buffer` of the `string`: "prereq"
2. The `Buffer` of the public key of the transaction signer

They are then combined into a single Buffer, along with the `program` ID, to create a deterministic address for this account. The `findProgramAddressSync` function is then going to combine this with a `bump` to find an address that is not on the elliptic curve and return the derived address, as well as the bump which we will not be using in this example:

```ts
// Create the PDA for our enrollment account
const enrollment_seeds = [Buffer.from("prereq"), keypair.publicKey.toBuffer()];
const [enrollment_key, _bump] = PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync(enrollment_seeds, program.programId);
```

Remember to familiarize yourself with this concept as you'll be using it often!

#### 5.3 Putting it all together
Now that we have everything we need, it's finally time to put it all together and make a transaction interacting with the devnet program to submit our `github` account and our `publicKey` to signify our completion of the WBA pre-requisite materials!

```ts
// Execute our enrollment transaction
(async () => {
    try {
        const txhash = await program.methods
        .complete(github)
        .accounts({
            signer: keypair.publicKey,
            prereq: enrollment_key,
            systemProgram: SystemProgram.programId,
        })
        .signers([
            keypair
        ]).rpc();
        console.log(`Success! Check out your TX here: 
        https://explorer.solana.com/tx/${txhash}?cluster=devnet`);
    } catch(e) {
        console.error(`Oops, something went wrong: ${e}`)
    }
})();
```

Congratulations, you have completed the WBA Solana Q2 Pre-requisite coursework!
